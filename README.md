🌱 Data Scientist | Machine Learning Enthusiast | AI Developer  

### 🚀 About Me  
I hold a **BSc Honours in Physics (Cum Laude)** and have a knack for solving problems whether it's debugging code, optimizing models, or figuring out why my coffee always gets cold too fast. With a strong foundation in **software engineering and data science**, I specialize in **machine learning, artificial intelligence, and backend development**.  

I've worked on exciting projects like **anime recommender systems, news classification models, and retail sales forecasting**—basically, making machines smarter so humans can take longer coffee breaks. My expertise extends to **Data Analysis, Machine Learning algorithms, Python, R, SQL, and Data Visualization**, helping me extract insights and build predictive models that (hopefully) impress both humans and machines.  

Currently, I'm diving into **Medical Physics and NLP**, blending my physics background with AI to (hopefully) do something cool. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me exploring new tech trends, optimizing models, or questioning why Python’s `print()` function doesn’t need semicolons.  

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
