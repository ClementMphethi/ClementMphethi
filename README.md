🌱 Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer | Data Analyst 🚀 

### Who am i?  
My name is Clement Moshohlo Mphethi, i am a Data Scientist, Machine Learning engineer and an aspiring AI Developer 👨🏽‍💻. I hold a **BSc Honours in Physics (Cum Laude)** and have a knack for solving problems whether it's debugging code, optimizing models or figuring out why my coffee always gets cold too fast😄. With a strong foundation in **software engineering and data science**, I specialize in **data analysis, machine learning algorithms and backend development**.  

I've worked on exciting projects like **anime recommender systems, news classification models and retail sales forecasting** basically, making machines smarter🤖 so that humans can take longer coffee breaks. My expertise extends to **Python, R, SQL and Data Visualization 📊**, helping me extract insights and build predictive models that hopefully impress both humans and machines.  

Currently, I'm diving into **Medical Physics and Artificial intelligence**, blending my physics background with AI to hopefully do something cool🤓. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me exploring new tech trends, optimizing models or questioning why Python’s `print()` function doesn’t need semicolons😄.  

### 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Languages**: Python, R, SQL, JavaScript, C  
- **Data Science & ML**: Data Analysis, Machine Learning Algorithms, Data Visualization
